Website Development class is one of the practical classes that makes me improve frontend programming ability and technical skills to easily find a job in IT fields in the future. 
The first semester assignment is to create a personal website as a portfolio and use and manage code on Github. 
After learning about fundamentals of HTML and CSS, I started to design the general layout and brainstorm the main items I will include on the website. 
My initial difficulty is to fully understand CSS grid, flexbox and how to apply them to create a website layout. 
Not only did I revise the lessons in class, but I also learned more online and watched tutorials to have a good grasp of the concepts. 
I found out that W3School, CSS-Tricks and Youtube are really useful sources for self-study and reference, which enabled me to design my website layout more easily. 
My desire is to make my website look professional but impressive so I chose the main palette are black, pink and white. 
I also surfed the Internet to find inspiration from some portfolios.  
I've already learned about how to manage code via Git, especially initializing a repo and committing files so I had nearly no difficulty with the Github set up. 
After adding main items in the page layout, I struggled a lot to make my website responsive for both mobile and desktop. My first version website was really disorienting in mobile screen size. 
Consistency is my key to adjust small elements such as buttons, images and font sizes to make them look good on mobile screen. 
To finalize and make my website eye-catching, I added transitions and a keyframe animation to some small details in my website. 
I also applied lesson about advanced CSS in week 6 into my code to make it more professional.  After 7 weeks coding a website, I gained not only programming knowledge but also valuable skills which can make me successful in the workplace. 
I emerged with a sense of creativity in designing layout. 
Confronted with unfamiliar terms, I honed my ability to research and delve into the unknown. 
Through the process of debugging, I cultivated problem-solving skills and persistence that proved invaluable in overcoming obstacles.
