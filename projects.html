                                <p>Website Development class is one of the practical classes that makes me improve
                                    frontend programming ability and technical skills to easily find a job in IT fields
                                    in the future. The first semester assignment is to create a personal website as a
                                    portfolio and use and manage code on Github.

                                    After learning about fundamentals of HTML and CSS, I started to design the general
                                    layout and brainstorm the main items I will include on the website. My initial
                                    difficulty is to fully understand CSS grid, flexbox and how to apply them to create
                                    a website layout. Not only did I revise the lessons in class, but I also learned
                                    more online and watched tutorials to have a good grasp of the concepts. I found out
                                    that W3School, CSS-Tricks and Youtube are really useful sources for self-study and
                                    reference, which enabled me to design my website layout more easily. My desire is to
                                    make my website look professional but impressive so I chose the main palette are
                                    black, pink and white. I also surfed the Internet to find inspiration from some
                                    portfolios. 

                                    I've already learned about how to manage code via Git, especially initializing a
                                    repo and committing files so I had nearly no difficulty with the Github set up.
                                    After adding main items in the page layout, I struggled a lot to make my website
                                    responsive for both mobile and desktop. My first version website was really
                                    disorienting in mobile screen size. Consistency is my key to adjust small elements
                                    such as buttons, images and font sizes to make them look good on mobile screen. To
                                    finalize and make my website eye-catching, I added transitions and a keyframe
                                    animation to some small details in my website. I also applied lesson about advanced
                                    CSS in week 6 into my code to make it more professional. 

                                    After 7 weeks coding a website, I gained not only programming knowledge but also
                                    valuable skills which can make me successful in the workplace. I emerged with a

                                    my ability to research and delve into the unknown. Through the process of debugging,
                                    I cultivated problem-solving skills and persistence that proved invaluable in
                                    overcoming obstacles.</p>

                                <h2> WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                                <p>Website Development class is one of the practical classes that makes me improve
                                    frontend programming ability and technical skills to easily find a job in IT fields
                                    in the future. The first semester assignment is to create a personal website as a
                                    portfolio and use and manage code on Github.

                                    After learning about fundamentals of HTML and CSS, I started to design the general
                                    layout and brainstorm the main items I will include on the website. My initial
                                    difficulty is to fully understand CSS grid, flexbox and how to apply them to create
                                    a website layout. Not only did I revise the lessons in class, but I also learned
                                    more online and watched tutorials to have a good grasp of the concepts. I found out
                                    that W3School, CSS-Tricks and Youtube are really useful sources for self-study and
                                    reference, which enabled me to design my website layout more easily. My desire is to
                                    make my website look professional but impressive so I chose the main palette are
                                    black, pink and white. I also surfed the Internet to find inspiration from some
                                    portfolios. 

                                    I've already learned about how to manage code via Git, especially initializing a
                                    repo and committing files so I had nearly no difficulty with the Github set up.
                                    After adding main items in the page layout, I struggled a lot to make my website
                                    responsive for both mobile and desktop. My first version website was really
                                    disorienting in mobile screen size. Consistency is my key to adjust small elements
                                    such as buttons, images and font sizes to make them look good on mobile screen. To
                                    finalize and make my website eye-catching, I added transitions and a keyframe
                                    animation to some small details in my website. I also applied lesson about advanced
                                    CSS in week 6 into my code to make it more professional. 

                                    After 7 weeks coding a website, I gained not only programming knowledge but also
                                    valuable skills which can make me successful in the workplace. I emerged with a
                                    sense of creativity in designing layout. Confronted with unfamiliar terms, I honed
